# WhatToWear

## Step 1: Define the Application Scope and Requirements

### Application Scope
- WhatToWear is a web application that provides clothing suggestions for Runs/Walks based on weather conditions.
- The application will utilize weather data, including temperature, precipitation, sky conditions, wind conditions, time of day, humidity level, and UV levels, to generate appropriate clothing recommendations.
- The weather data will be fetched from Apple's Visual Crossing API.
- The application will consider user preferences such as gender and desired comfort level (cold/hot) when suggesting clothing options.
- The application will focus specifically on providing recommendations for Runs/Walks.

### Requirements
1. User Interface:
   - Design and develop a user-friendly interface where users can input their gender, desired comfort level, and potentially other relevant details.
   - Display the recommended clothing options based on the weather conditions and user preferences.
   - Provide an appealing and intuitive user experience.

2. Weather Data Integration:
   - Integrate Apple's Visual Crossing API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's location or a location of their choice.
   - Retrieve weather information including temperature, precipitation, sky conditions, wind conditions, time of day, humidity level, and UV levels.

3. Recommendation Engine:
   - Implement a recommendation engine that takes the fetched weather data and user preferences into account to suggest appropriate clothing options.
   - Consider factors such as temperature ranges, precipitation levels, wind conditions, and time of day to determine suitable attire for Runs/Walks.
   - Incorporate gender-specific recommendations if desired.

4. Backend Development:
   - Develop a backend server using Python and a web framework like Django or Flask to handle user requests, process data, and interact with the Visual Crossing API.
   - Implement necessary API endpoints to fetch weather data and deliver clothing recommendations to the frontend.

5. Frontend Development:
   - Create the frontend using React to design and implement the user interface.
   - Integrate the API endpoints to fetch weather data and receive clothing recommendations from the backend.
   - Ensure a responsive and visually appealing design that aligns with the application's purpose.

6. Testing and Debugging:
   - Implement comprehensive testing strategies to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's functionalities.
   - Test the integration with the Visual Crossing API and verify the accuracy of the clothing recommendations.
   - Use debugging techniques and tools to identify and resolve any issues or errors.

7. Deployment and Maintenance:
   - Choose a hosting platform or server to deploy your web application.
   - Set up necessary infrastructure and configurations for deployment.
   - Regularly monitor and maintain the application, including updating weather data, addressing any bug fixes or performance improvements, and ensuring the integration with the Visual Crossing API remains functional.

## Step 2: Design the Application Architecture

Let's proceed with designing the application architecture for your WhatToWear web application. Here's an outline of the architecture:

1. Frontend:
   - The frontend of your application will be developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - Use React components to create the user interface for inputting user preferences (gender, desired comfort level) and displaying the recommended clothing options.
   - Implement data fetching from the backend API to retrieve weather data and receive clothing recommendations.

2. Backend:
   - The backend of your application will be developed using Python, utilizing a web framework such as Django or Flask.
   - Create the necessary backend components to handle user requests, process data, and interact with the Visual Crossing API.
   - Implement API endpoints to receive user preferences, fetch weather data from the Visual Crossing API, and send clothing recommendations to the frontend.

3. Visual Crossing API Integration:
   - Integrate Apple's Visual Crossing API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's location or a location of their choice.
   - Use the appropriate libraries or modules in Python to make HTTP requests to the Visual Crossing API and retrieve weather information.
   - Process the received weather data and extract the relevant parameters such as temperature, precipitation, sky conditions, wind conditions, time of day, humidity level, and UV levels.

4. Recommendation Engine:
   - Develop a recommendation engine that takes the fetched weather data and user preferences into account to generate appropriate clothing suggestions.
   - Use algorithms and logic to analyze the weather conditions and user preferences and determine the suitable attire for Runs/Walks.
   - Consider factors such as temperature ranges, precipitation levels, wind conditions, and time of day to provide accurate and relevant clothing recommendations.

5. Database (Optional):
   - Depending on the requirements of your application, you may consider integrating a database to store user preferences, locations, or historical weather data.
   - Choose a suitable database system such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, and design the database schema accordingly.
   - Implement database operations to store and retrieve data as needed.

6. Deployment and Hosting:
   - Select a hosting platform or server to deploy your web application, such as Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
   - Configure the deployment environment and ensure all necessary dependencies are included.
   - Set up appropriate security measures and configurations to protect user data and ensure secure communication with the Visual Crossing API.

7. Third-Party Libraries and Tools:
   - Explore and utilize relevant Python libraries for web development, such as Django or Flask for the backend, and libraries like requests for making HTTP requests to the Visual Crossing API.
   - Leverage React libraries and tools for frontend development, such as Axios for making API calls to the backend.
   - Consider additional libraries or tools for UI components, data visualization, or styling to enhance the user experience.

Remember to consider scalability, maintainability, and extensibility when designing the architecture. This outline provides a high-level overview, and you may need to dive deeper into each component during the implementation phase.
